I started learning to code freshman year of high school through a site called ROBLOX.  I learned to code Lua, making it my first coding language I have used.  After freshman year, I went on to learn web development languages including HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript.  During my freshman and sophomore year of high school, I spent my free time coding and designing computer games through the ROBLOX site.
